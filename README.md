# ITWSaveScratch

A scratch project for my team's Grade 12 computer science class project, which was a 2D RPG game based on the musical Into the Woods. 
This scratch project tests player save functionality. A player can save their progress, close the game, and then re-open at a later time and pick up at the point where they left off.
